# FastBun

###### *Look at that bun! It runs!*

### What's FastBun?

Besides being the fastest bun on the planet, FastBun is a **template repository** that uses **[Bun](https://bun.sh)** and **[Turbo](https://turbo.build)**

### What for?

Made in the first place for my personal use, FastBun is only a utility template repository to create other repository **regardless** of the frameworks the developer will use.

The one example you'll find in my GitHub repositories is [FastBunStarter](https://github.com/aburii/FastBunStarter) that is (also) a template repository for my own stack :D

### Additional informations

Nothing here for now :), updates might come in the future about the lint engine, shell scripts. 

Feel free to use it for time gain purposes and suggest changes if needed :D
